Sims have long-term desires they want to fulfill, such as&#xA;getting married, having a baby, or dying. In addition to desiring what's&#xA;good or natural for them, Sims also desire what's good for the world's&#xA;balance, since they are socially responsible individuals.&#xA;&#xA;Sims will score actions based on their personality and how much sense it&#xA;makes for them to perform it. For example, a recently married Sim will want&#xA;to have a baby soon, perhaps. Traits might affect this, such as Sims with&#xA;the Hates Children trait wanting to perform this action less.&#xA;&#xA;However, in addition to Sim-centric scoring, the actions are also scored&#xA;based on the increase or (hopefully) decrease in error between the current&#xA;state of the world and the desired balance. For instance, Sims are going to&#xA;be less likely to conceive children in an over-populated world.&#xA;&#xA;Actions take time to run. No meaningful simulation happens between picking&#xA;an action and executing: it is merely a way to control pacing. Other&#xA;gameplay might be unlocked by a Sim being in the process of running an&#xA;action, such as being able to run specific socials, asking for advice,&#xA;generating secrets, etc..." instance_needs_reference="True" instance_subclasses_only="False" path="StoryProgressionActions\Descriptions" use_guid_for_reference="True">
