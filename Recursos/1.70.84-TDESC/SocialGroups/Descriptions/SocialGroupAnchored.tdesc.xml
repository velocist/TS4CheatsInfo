Instead, they&#xA;   route directly to their final constraint.&#xA;&#xA; * The anchor object of this group is the &quot;picked object&quot; of the initiating&#xA;   social super interaction. The picked object is the target of the pushing&#xA;   picker interaction. This group *must* be created as part of a picker -&gt;&#xA;   social interaction flow.&#xA;   &#xA; * The constraint for this group are always centered around the anchor&#xA;   object.
